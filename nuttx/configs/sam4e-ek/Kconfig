	---help---
		Create the MTD driver for the AT25 and "wrap" the AT25 as a standard
		block driver that could then, for example, be mounted using FAT or
		any other file system.  Any file system may be used, but there will
		be no wear-leveling.

config SAM4EEK_AT25_NXFFS
	bool "Create AT25 serial FLASH NXFFS file system"
	depends on FS_NXFFS
	---help---
		Create the MTD driver for the AT25 and mount the AT25 device as
		a wear-leveling, NuttX FLASH file system (NXFFS).  The downside of
		NXFFS is that it can be very slow.
